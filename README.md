Intro
The appropriate changes have been made to your html and css code which ensure accessibility, optimization, and sustainability standards.

Changes for Accessibility
1. All image elements have been given alt attributes to assist with any viewers that have disabilities
2. An id tag was missing for "search-engine-optimization" which did not allow for the navingation link to work

Changes for Optimization
1. The title has been updated to give a quick view of the Horiseon brand
2. HTML class and id attributes have been condensed, removed or changed due to unecessary repetition
3. CSS styles have been condensed following the above, so that there is no repetitive code for multiple elements
4. CSS selectors were re-organized to match the proper order coinciding with their respective HTML elements -> whole document - header & nav - section 1 - section 2 (article, aside) - footer

Changes for Sustainability
1. Most div tags were removed and semantic HTML elements were added in place
2. Structure was provided to differentiate between elements in the HTML
3. Notes in the CSS code were added to break up the different sections being targeted

In no particular order, the changes are as follows: BLAH BLAH
1. xUpdated all image tags to have an alt attribute
2. xAn id tag was given to xx to allow for the nav to work for the 1st one gaaaaaaaaaaaah
3. xCondensed css styling to target multiple tags with the same xx to have less lines
4. xRemoved repetitive class elements where id's sufficed. This includes updating in css.
5. xThe title has been updated to "Horiseon Social Solution Services" to give webpage viewers a quick sum of what Horiseon does
6. xThe targets in css have been re-organized to be in matching order of sequence same as html
7. xMain divs have been given id tags instead of class as they are unique
8. Within the main divs multiple different class tags were given which has been condensed into one (main-services) to target at at once
9. xSemantic HTML elements were added
